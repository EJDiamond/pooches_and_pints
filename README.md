### Design

#### Colour Scheme
- The two main colours used are green and cream.

#### Typography
- The Abril Fatface font is used for the headings, whilst the main body font used is Poppins light, both being used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The fonts pair well together and are clean and easy to read making them both attractive and appropriate.

#### Imagery
- The hero image placed, represents simply what the website is for, meeting up and socialising with other dog owners.
