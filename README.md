# Pooches & Pints

Pooches and Pints is a site bringing together people and their pets across the Manchester area. Pet owners looking to meet and socialise with other people will come to the site to join others at organsied times and locations. People without transport who are normally confined to the city will be able to get out and explore with the help of fellow dog walkers, and those who normally walk alone will find friends in the community and enjoy their pets together.

#### Colour Scheme

#### Typography
- The Abril Fatface font is used for the headings, whilst the main body font used is Poppins light, both being used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The fonts pair well together and are clean and easy to read making them both attractive and appropriate.

#### Imagery
- The hero image placed, represents simply what the website is for, meeting up and socialising with other dog owners.
